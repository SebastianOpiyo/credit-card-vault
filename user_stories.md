## As a merchant,
* I want to store customer's credit card details in a secure vault,
* So that I can invoice customers without having to collect their credit card information again.

## Acceptance Criteria:

    * The credit card information must be encrypted and decrypted using a secure algorithm.
    * Access to the credit card vault must be restricted to authorized users.
    * The Biba Model and Bell-LaPadula model must be implemented to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the credit card information.

## Use Cases:

    * Customer enters their credit card information into the merchant's website.
    * The merchant's website encrypts the credit card information and stores it in the credit card vault.
    * The next time the customer makes a purchase, the merchant's website retrieves the credit card information from the vault and uses it to process the payment.

## Non-Functional Requirements:

    * The credit card vault must be highly available.
    * The credit card vault must be secure.
    * The credit card vault must be scalable.

## Risks:

    * The credit card information could be stolen if the vault is not secure.
    * The credit card information could be modified if the vault is not properly implemented.
    * The credit card vault could be unavailable if it is not properly maintained.

## Testing:

    * The credit card vault must be tested to ensure that it is secure and that the credit card information is not accessible to unauthorized users.
    * The credit card vault must be tested to ensure that it is scalable and can handle a large number of transactions.
